	Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in computer 
		files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily
		used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to
		keep track of changes in any set of files.
    Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free, online, cloud-based platform for running Python
		code, particularly well-suited for machine learning and data analysis. It provides
		a Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud, allowing users to write and
		execute code without requiring local setup.
